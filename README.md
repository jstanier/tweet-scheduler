===============

Work out when it's best to schedule your tweets.

## Where did I get the data from?

This current version uses statistics for the best times to post for click-through rate (CTR), which was found in a [Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/belle-beth-cooper/a-scientific-guide-to-pos_b_4262571.html).

The particular graphs that I used were these:
